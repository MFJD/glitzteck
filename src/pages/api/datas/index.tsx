    href: '#',
    description:
        'The challenges of technology in Africa include infrastructure limitations, such as unreliable electricity and internet connectivity, hindering tech adoption. Additionally, low digital literacy and tech skills among the population, limited funding and investment for tech startups, and weak regulatory frameworks create obstacles for tech innovation. Cybersecurity threats also pose a significant risk due to limited expertise and resources. Despite these challenges, Africa has made significant progress in tech adoption and innovation. However, the continent still faces issues like brain drain, limited local content and services, and dependence on international tech solutions. Furthermore, tech access and benefits often exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. Addressing these challenges is crucial to unlocking Africa full tech potential and promoting inclusive and sustainable digital growth.',
